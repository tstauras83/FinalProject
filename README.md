prioritized from highest to lowest:

    1. Event creation, management, and deletion: The ability to create, manage, and delete events is the core feature of the system.

    2. Guest and staff logging: The ability to log guests and staff that attend or work each event is critical for keeping track of attendance and staffing needs.

    3. Staff assignment: The ability to assign staff to events is important for ensuring adequate staffing levels and managing schedules.

    4. Account management: User authentication and authorization functionality, and creating user roles for guests, staff, and administrators.

    5. Email notifications: Developing email notifications for events, updates, and reminders is important for keeping users informed about upcoming events and any changes to them.

    6. Reporting: Adding reporting functionality to generate reports on event attendance, staff allocation, and other relevant data is useful for analyzing event data and making informed decisions.

    7. Customizable views: Developing customizable views for different user roles is important for providing a personalized user experience and ensuring that users only see the information they need.

    8. Data security: Implementing security measures such as encryption, password hashing, and SSL to protect sensitive data is essential for maintaining the integrity of the system.

    9. Payment processing: Integrating a payment processing system such as Stripe or PayPal if you plan on charging for events can be added at a later stage, as it is not a core feature for the system to function.
